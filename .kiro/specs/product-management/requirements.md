# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing shopping website with product management capabilities, authentication, and improved code quality. The current website is a React-based application with a simple Express backend and SQLite database. It features product listing, a shopping cart with sale item handling, and basic checkout functionality. The enhancements will add user authentication, product management capabilities for administrators, and comprehensive testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication System

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want to securely log in to the system, so that I can access administrative features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a login form with fields for email and password.
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to the appropriate dashboard.
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.
4. WHEN an authenticated user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page.
5. WHEN an authenticated user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL end their session and redirect to the homepage.
6. WHEN a user attempts to access protected routes THEN the system SHALL verify authentication status before granting access.
7. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL validate email format and password strength.
8. WHEN storing user passwords THEN the system SHALL use secure hashing algorithms.

### Requirement 2: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a system owner, I want different user roles with appropriate permissions, so that I can control access to administrative features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is created THEN the system SHALL assign them a default role of "customer".
2. WHEN an administrator creates a user THEN the system SHALL allow assigning roles of "customer" or "admin".
3. WHEN a user with "admin" role logs in THEN the system SHALL provide access to product management features.
4. WHEN a user with "customer" role logs in THEN the system SHALL restrict access to administrative features.
5. WHEN an unauthenticated user visits the site THEN the system SHALL only allow access to public pages.
6. WHEN an API request is made to protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL verify the user has appropriate role permissions.

### Requirement 3: Product Management Interface

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a product management interface, so that I can add, edit, and delete products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin navigates to the product management page THEN the system SHALL display a list of all products with key information.
2. WHEN an admin clicks "Add Product" THEN the system SHALL display a form to enter product details.
3. WHEN an admin submits the add product form THEN the system SHALL validate and save the new product.
4. WHEN an admin clicks "Edit" on a product THEN the system SHALL display a form pre-populated with the product's current details.
5. WHEN an admin submits the edit product form THEN the system SHALL validate and update the product.
6. WHEN an admin clicks "Delete" on a product THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before deletion.
7. WHEN an admin confirms product deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the product from the database.
8. WHEN a product is added or edited THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields before saving.

### Requirement 4: Image Upload and Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to upload and manage product images, so that I can maintain visual product information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin adds or edits a product THEN the system SHALL provide an image upload option.
2. WHEN an admin uploads an image THEN the system SHALL validate the file type and size.
3. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it securely and generate appropriate thumbnails.
4. WHEN an admin views the product list THEN the system SHALL display product thumbnails.
5. WHEN an admin deletes a product THEN the system SHALL also remove associated image files.
6. WHEN an admin replaces a product image THEN the system SHALL update all references to use the new image.
7. WHEN an image upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.

### Requirement 5: Inventory Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage product inventory, so that I can track stock levels and sale quantities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin adds or edits a product THEN the system SHALL provide fields for regular and sale inventory quantities.
2. WHEN a customer purchases a product THEN the system SHALL update the appropriate inventory quantity.
3. WHEN inventory reaches a configurable low threshold THEN the system SHALL highlight this in the admin interface.
4. WHEN an admin views the product list THEN the system SHALL display current inventory levels.
5. WHEN an admin updates inventory quantities THEN the system SHALL validate that values are non-negative integers.
6. WHEN a product is out of stock THEN the system SHALL indicate this on the product display and prevent purchase.

### Requirement 6: Code Quality and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive code comments and test coverage, so that I can maintain and extend the codebase with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN developers SHALL find clear, consistent comments explaining complex logic.
2. WHEN running the test suite THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 95% code coverage.
3. WHEN a new feature is implemented THEN unit tests SHALL be written to verify its functionality.
4. WHEN API endpoints are implemented THEN integration tests SHALL verify their behavior.
5. WHEN UI components are created THEN component tests SHALL verify their rendering and interaction.
6. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL execute without manual configuration in CI/CD environments.
7. WHEN edge cases are identified THEN specific tests SHALL be written to handle them.

### Requirement 7: Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive and up-to-date documentation, so that I can quickly understand the system and its components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new feature is implemented THEN the README.md SHALL be updated to reflect the changes.
2. WHEN database schemas are modified THEN the documentation SHALL be updated with the new schema details.
3. WHEN new API endpoints are added THEN the documentation SHALL include their purpose, parameters, and response formats.
4. WHEN authentication mechanisms are implemented THEN the documentation SHALL include user roles and access instructions.
5. WHEN configuration options are added THEN the documentation SHALL explain their purpose and usage.
6. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN developers SHALL find clear instructions for setting up and using the system.
7. WHEN project dependencies change THEN the documentation SHALL be updated to reflect the new requirements.
